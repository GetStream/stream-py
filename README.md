Check out our:

- ‚≠ê [Chat API](https://getstream.io/chat/)
- üì± [Video API](https://getstream.io/video/)
- üîî [Activity Feeds](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/)

## Features

- Video call creation and management
- Chat session creation and management
- Token generation for user authentication

## Installation

To install the Stream Client Library, run the following command:

```sh
pip install getstream

# or if like us, you fell in love with uv
uv add getstream
```

If you want to use the openai realtime integration, you need to install the package with the additional dependencies:

```sh
pip install getstream[openai-realtime]

# or using uv
uv add 'getstream[openai-realtime]'
```

## Usage

To get started, you need to import the `Stream` class from the library and create a new instance with your API key and secret:

```python
from getstream import Stream

client = Stream(api_key="your_api_key", api_secret="your_api_secret")
```

### Users and Authentication

```python
from getstream.models import UserRequest

# sync two users using the update_users method, both users will get insert or updated
client.upsert_users(
    UserRequest(
        id="tommaso-id", name="tommaso", role="admin", custom={"country": "NL"}
    ),
    UserRequest(
        id="thierry-id", name="thierry", role="admin", custom={"country": "US"}
    ),
)

# Create a JWT token for the user to connect client-side (e.g. browser/mobile app)
token = client.create_token("tommaso-id")
```

### Video API - Calls

To create a video call, use the `client.video.call` method:

```python
import uuid
from getstream.models import (
    CallRequest,
    MemberRequest,
)

call = client.video.call("default", uuid.uuid4())
call.get_or_create(
    data=CallRequest(
        created_by_id="tommaso-id",
        members=[
            MemberRequest(user_id="thierry-id"),
            MemberRequest(user_id="tommaso-id"),
        ],
    ),
)
```

### App configuration

```python
# Video: update settings for a call type

# Chat: update settings for a channel type
```


### Chat API - Channels

To work with chat sessions, use the `client.chat` object and implement the desired chat methods in the `Chat` class:

```python
chat_instance = client.chat

# TODO: implement and call chat-related methods with chat_instance
```

## Development

We use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage dependencies and run tests. It's a package manager for Python that allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and manage them.
To install the development dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
uv venv --python 3.12.2
uv sync --all-extras --dev
pre-commit install
```

To run tests, create a `.env` using the `.env.example` and adjust it to have valid API credentials
```sh
uv run pytest tests/ getstream/
```

Before pushing changes make sure to have git hooks installed correctly, so that you get linting done locally `pre-commit install`

You can also run the code formatting yourself if needed:

```sh
uv run ruff format getstream/ tests/
```

### Writing new tests

pytest is used to run tests and to inject fixtures, simple tests can be written as simple python functions making assert calls. Make sure to have a look at the available test fixtures under `tests/fixtures.py`

#### Skipping Tests in CI

Some tests may not be suitable for running in a CI environment (GitHub Actions). To skip a test in CI, use the `@pytest.mark.skip_in_ci` decorator:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.skip_in_ci
def test_something():
    # This test will be skipped when running in GitHub Actions
    ...
```

The test will run normally in local development environments but will be automatically skipped when running in GitHub Actions.

### Generate code from spec

To regenerate the Python source from OpenAPI, just run the `./generate.sh` script from this repo.

> [!NOTE]
> Code generation currently relies on tooling that is not publicly available, only Stream devs can regenerate SDK source code from the OpenAPI spec.
